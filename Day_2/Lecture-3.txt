	Types of ML 

There are many types of ML but main are 4:

1 -> Supervised Machine Learning 

	i  -> Regression
	ii -> Classification
	
2 -> UnSupervised Machine Learing

	i  -> Clustering 
	ii -> Dimensionality Reduction
	iii -> Anomal Reduction
	iv -> Association Learning


3 -> Semi Supervised
4 -> Reinforcement

Types of Data:

We have 2 types of Data:

-> Numerical    

Age , IQ , CGPA , Weight

-> Categorical

Gender , Nationality 


1 -> Supervised Machine Learning

Machine Learning is all about Learning from data. So, If in data you have both input and output but you want to find the realtion between them.

So for the new input you will tell the output. So this learning is called Supervised Machine Learning.

Lets suppose we have data of 5000 students.

Iq	CGPA	Placement(y / n)

76	7.8	Yes
84	8.1	Yes
56	6.3	No

So in this data set we have both input and output. From this dataset our ML model recognize the main relationship between the input and output for future use.

Note :  We use mostly Supervised Machine Learning ahead.

i-> Regression

Let's suppose we have a Supervised ML problem. It means in the dataset we have both input and output columns.

We just have to check that wether the output column is numerical or categorical. If column is numerical then we use Regression model there.

i-> Classification

Let's suppose we have a Supervised ML problem. It means in the dataset we have both input and output columns.

We just have to check that wether the output column is numerical or categorical. If column is catergorical then we use Classification model there.

For Example: 

->  If we have a dateset where all the info of the house is stored like how many rooms , bathrooms and kitchens and in the output we have house pize. 

Then we use Regression Model there.

->  As we dicussed before about the dataset of students. It will be the example of Classification model.


2-> UnSupervised Machine Learning
