-> What is Data Frame?

A data frame is like a table in which you can organize and store data. It has rows and columns, where:

Each column represents a different type of data (e.g., names, ages, scores).

Each row represents a single data entry (e.g., one person's details across different columns).

In programming, data frames are used to handle and manipulate data efficiently, especially in languages like Python (using pandas) and R.
