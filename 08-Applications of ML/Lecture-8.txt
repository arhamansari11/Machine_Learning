Applications of Machine Learning

B to B 	Bussiness to Bussiness Example.



i -> Retail Amazon / Big Bazaar. 

6 CR+ products on Amazon. 

When the sale opens on Amazon. If they give sales on every 6CR+ products. Then they have to increase their products becuase on sale products sale maximum.

So what they do they check the previous sales data and apply machine learning algorithm on it and then filter out the products.

Let's suppse you go to the any mall like chase up and you purchase some products then give you their number.

Now you purchase health related products. or maybe electronics products.

Then these companies sell your number to gym or maybe watches seller.

1 lakh phone numbers and 100 phone numbers worth it. It's called B to B.

Baby Diaper , bear like setting of the products on Mall.

Machine Learning is the key factor in e-commerce.



ii -> Banking / Finance

Promotion plans , where we open the banks etc.

Let's suppose you want to take loan from bank. So the ML algorithm compare your profile with the previous defaulters profile. 

If your accuracy comes higher not give me loan otherwise give loan.





iii -> Transport. / Uber

Your paying rate is highness from 8am to 8pm but in night it would be half.

Let's suppse if your price is 100 it will charge 300.

Prices are higher due to increase demand. Customers are high and busses are low.




iv -> Manufacturing.

Predictive Maintainace. We correct the things when the things get wrong. But in predictive manufacturing we correct the things before wrong.

Like the cars are made by robots so if the robot is not okay the car is not made?

There is a chip in the robots that detect the capacity. The engineers maybe fix the range of chip like if there are below 300 there will be an error in machine.
