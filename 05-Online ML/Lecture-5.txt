Many companies are talking about Online Machine Learning.

It means they train there model according to it like on the way on the server there model improve by new data.

Online machine learning refers to a model training approach where the algorithm learns from data in a sequential manner, updating its knowledge as new data arrives. 

Unlike traditional batch learning, which requires the entire dataset to be processed at once, online learning processes data incrementally. 

This is particularly useful for situations where data is too large to fit into memory, or when the data is constantly changing and needs to be updated in real-time.

Real-time Recommendation Systems:

Platforms like Netflix or Amazon use online machine learning to update recommendations in real-time based on user interactions and preferences. 

As users watch movies or browse products, the system continuously adapts and improves its recommendations.

Spam Detection:

Email services such as Gmail use online learning to classify incoming emails as spam or not spam. 

The system updates its model with new data about spam and non-spam emails to improve accuracy over time.

When to use?	

i-> Where there is a concept drift	

What is concept drift?

You made a machine learning model to solve a problem but the nature of the problem change again and again.

Like : Stock Market and E-commmerce store -> Seasons , Sales

So in scenerior where nature of the problem change very fastly so you have to use Online learning there.

ii-> Cost Effective	It's too much cost effective as compared to batch machine learning

iii-> Faster Solution  Since we give data in small batches so its faster.
