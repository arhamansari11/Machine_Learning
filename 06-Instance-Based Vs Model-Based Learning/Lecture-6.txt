Machine Learning Model train data in two forms.

There are two ways to train our model that is:

i -> Memorizing

ii -> Generalization

In memorizing our algorithm memorize all the data and works according to them. This is called Instance Based Learning.

In Generalization our algorithm underline the concept behind them. This is called Model Based Learning.


-> Instance Based Learning

iq	cgpa	placement (yes / no)

8	80	y
7	7.5	n

It gives result according to their neighbours.

There is not concept of training and learning in Instance based learning.

We mostly use KNN (K nearest Neighbour) Algorithm in Instance Based Learning.

Model-based machine learning refers to a type of machine learning approach where the learning process involves constructing and training a model based on the data. 

The goal is to create a model that can make predictions or decisions based on input data.
