Why we start Tensosrs when we start practical implementation of ML?

As we also an other topic like NUM.py , pandans and any other library but why we start with tensors.

Tensor is basically a data strucutre . Data strucuture means a method to store data.

So , why we learn tensors the reason is every machine learning system or leading libraries like sickit learn , tensor flow use tensors more frequently 

Like Tensros is the basic data structure that these libraies are used.

So tensors are not only used in ML but also it use on DL. So tensors is important in both.

So you may assume that how much tensors are important like the no.1 ML or DL Library name are Tensor Flow.

In simple words tensors are nothing but the data strucutue that store numerical values.

Like tensor work as a container that store numerical values mostly. It also store string and other data types but its very very rare like 99.9% we use numercal values.

What is tensor?

If you ever study about vectors and matrices than actually you used tensors.

When its 0D we called scalar number like single number . e.g 1 ,2 ,3

When its 1D we called them vectors or lists like arr = [1 ,2 , 4] 

When its 2D we called them matrix like [[1 , 2] , [2 ,4]]

So whats about 3d vectors and 4d , 5d we don't have their individual names so the scientists discover the term tensors that follow all the rules.





What are 0D Tensors / Scalars.

If we ever store only a single number then we called 0D tensors or Scalars

1 , 2 these are scalars we also called them 0D Tensors

Note: 0D Tensors means there are no dimensions like 0 Dimensions.	 





What are 1D Tensors . Vector?

If we have a list of numbers like this [1 , 2 , 4]

We called them 1D Tensors , 1D Array , Array and Vectors.

What are the dimensions of vector? Its 3 becuase dimensios of vectors depends on the number of elements in the array.




What are Axis?

Axis are basically like x axis , y axis , z axis

Number of Axis == dimensions in the Tensors.

Number of axis are also called rank and dimensions.





Note:  1D Tensors are basically collection of scalars  ,  2D Tensors are basically collection of Vectors ,  3D Tensors are basically collection of Matrixes






What are 2d Tensors?

2D Tensors are nothig but the collection of vectors like this
 
 [ [1 , 2 , 3]    ,     [4 ,  5 , 6 ]  ,  [7 ,8,9]    ]

Rank = 2 = ndim













We mostly used 0D to 5D Tensors


Rank , Axis  and  Space:

No of axis = Dimensions of tensors = No of ranks.

These 3 are same almost.

->  Shape of Matrix

Lets suppose we have a matrix of 3 * 3 it means we have 3 rows and 3 column. So the shape is (3 , 3).  2 * 3 -> shape is (2 , 3)

->  Size of Matrix

Multiple all elements of shape (3 , 3) = 9
