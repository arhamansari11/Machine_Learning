What is Production?

Production is basically the server on which your code is going to run.

Developement Enviornment:

When we code then it's called developement enviornment.

Production Enviornment:

When we deploy our code. Then it's called production enviornemnt.

Batch Machine Learning:

In Batch Machine Learning you train the model by all data. It means you don't train the model in chunks of data. We train the model by all data.

Batch Machine Learning is also called Ofline Machine Learning.

In Ofline Machine Learning we train our model ofline in our Machine. And then when the model will train we let them go to the produciton enviornment.

There is a problem that our model is static. It means our model learn once. Then it will work on the previous problem.

For example:

We train our model on netflix recomendation system. But the netflix are adding new movies every week. So we have to re train our model on that.

So this is the main disadvantage of the Ofline or Batch Machine Learning is we have to re train our model again and again then we have to deploy it.

Main Disadvantages of Machine Learning

1-> Lots of Data   -> If we have a lots of data and our code don't pulled it so it will not train. As we have to train the data at once.
2-> Hardware Limitation 
3-> Availability -> News update after 24 hours
